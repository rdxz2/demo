> Q: Where will the database be hosted on?<br>
> A: It will be set on top of GCP (Google Cloud Platform) VM (Virtual Machine). It will be a self-managed Postgres database.

> Q: All services need cost to maintain, who will be responsible to maintain the database operational cost?<br>
> A: You will be responsible to maintain all of the database operational cost (VM instances, snapshots, networking, SSLs if any, etc.), and I will help to optimize that cost. Don't hesitate to communicate your needs so we can figure out a scalable operational cost based on your needs!

> Q: How do I access my database?<br>
> A: If you want to use the database from a backend, then you will need to set up a connection from your backend to the database. If you want to visualize data from it, please check my other gig on "creating new Metabase instance", or just directly consult with me!

> Q: How do I manage my database?<br>
> A: I can directly give you administrator access to the database, or provide a database browser that you can access via your favourite web browser.

> Q: I don't know anything about managing the database, what should I do?<br>
> A: I can teach you database concepts, how to write query, and how to manage a database, with no additional costs!

> Q: After the database is created and initial setups are set, then what's next?<br>
> A: I will give you every possible access to fully manage the database, where you can later share it to the next maintainer.
